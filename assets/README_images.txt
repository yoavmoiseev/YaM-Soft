Expected filenames for language-specific hero backgrounds (PNG):
- bg-ru.png   -> background for Russian

- bg-he.png   -> background for Hebrew (use RTL-friendly image)

Other suggested files:

Notes:
- The site JS will automatically load `assets/bg-<lang>.png` based on selected language.
- If a file is missing, the CSS fallback color will be visible.
